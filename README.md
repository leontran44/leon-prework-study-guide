## Description

This Study Guide was built to help me understand basic concepts from the prework module in my bootcamp Web Development.
Topis include:
- Git
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I also enhanced my knowledge of these concepts by putting all of these concepts into this study guide. And gaining more confidence working around with **GitBash**, **VSCode**, **Google Chrome Dev**, **Git flow**.

## Usage

The guide is organized into four study areas for student review including Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript:

1. First, visit the webpage and open the DevTools console by pressing `Control+Shift+I` (Windows) or `Command+Option+I` (MacOS). 

2. Next, view the "console" tab. JavaScript will randomly pick one of the four content areas for you to study first. A new random selection is made when the page is refreshed.
